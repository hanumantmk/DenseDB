DenseDB
=======

DenseDB is a bit packing, file backed, db library for fixed width use in C.  It
presumes that you access rows by an integer index and that you know the number
of entries you're likely to want up front.

That's a pretty specific set of requirements and things may grow more flexible
with time, but that's what you've got for now.

Enjoy!
